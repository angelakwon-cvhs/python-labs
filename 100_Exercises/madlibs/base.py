# Create at least 10 variables here. You should have a mix of verbs, adjectives and nouns.




# Using print statements and your variables, create a mad libs style story.
# This means that if someone were to change the values of the variables above and ran your code, 
# they'd see a completely different story.





# Here's a (short) example if you need one
adjective1 = "shocking"
noun1 = "potato"
word1 = "ahoy"
past_adjective = "terrified"
print("I was walking to the store when suddenly a " + adjective1 + " " + noun1 + " flew past my face")
print("The " + noun1 + " said " + word1)
print("At the sound of its voice I was " + past_adjective)
